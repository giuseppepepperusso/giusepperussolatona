 I am currently a Postdoc at DLab at EPFL in Lausanne advised by Prof. Robert West. Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich advised by Prof. Frank Schweitzer. 

My research develops computational methods to tackle complex societal challenges, from content moderation in social media to improve the suistanability of food systems to reduction of polarization. I leverage massive data sources - such as digital traces, buy logs, and social media - to understand human behaviors and decisions at the center of such challenges. These data sources provide new opportunities to capture individuals at scale, with the potential to improve decisions that affect billions every day.

However, novel data also introduce challenges for analysis, such as the identification of causal relations in social media: e.g.,  how to estimate causal spillover effects of policies (ICWSM'24, ICWSM'23, WebSci'23), and how to extract precise signals from vast unlabeled data such as buy logs (arXiv'23), speeches (ACL 2023). To address these challenges, my research develops new methods blending machine learning, network science, and natural language processing. I use these methods to develop policy insights.
